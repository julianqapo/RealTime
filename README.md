# RealTime

we all have issues with controlling our time
especially when it comes to social media
so i had an idea about creating a website to solve this problem


p.s :
// copy any images to the same folder and add their name and press (add)
// it will be shown on the right side of the page
// by clicking on it, the background image would be changed
